Weather App üå¶Ô∏è
This is a simple weather application that provides current weather information and search functionality for different cities. It was developed by following a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp's YouTube channel.

Key Features
    Search Weather by City: Input a city name to retrieve real-time weather data.
    Current Location Weather: Automatically detects and displays weather information for your current location.
APIs Used
    OpenWeather API:
        Used to fetch real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
            Authentication: Requires an API key to access the weather data.
    GeoDB Cities API:
        Used to search and autocomplete city names efficiently.
            Authentication: Requires an API key provided by RapidAPI.
    
What I Learned
This project provided an opportunity to explore and gain hands-on experience with the following:

Fetch API: Learned how to make HTTP requests to external APIs using JavaScript's fetch function.
API Integration: Gained insights into how to use APIs for accessing third-party data.
API Keys: Understood how API keys are used for authentication and how to manage them securely.
Chaining APIs: Combined data from multiple APIs (GeoDB Cities and OpenWeather) to provide a seamless user experience.
Error Handling: Implemented basic error handling to deal with incorrect API requests or network issues.
